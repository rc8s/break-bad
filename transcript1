To all law-enforcement entities,

I am speaking to my family now.

Skyler.

You are the love of my life.

I hope you know that.

Walter Jr.

You're my big man.

There are-- There are going to be some things--

I just want you to know that no matter how it may look

Happy birthday.

Oh.

Look at that.

That is veggie bacon.

Believe it or not.

Zero cholesterol

and you won't even

taste the difference.

Mm.

What time do you think

you'll be home?

Same time.

I don't want him

dicking you around tonight.

You get paid till 5,

you work till 5. No later.

Ah-hah.

Hey.

Hey, happy birthday.

Well, thank you.

You're late again.

There was no hot water again.

I have an easy fix

for that.

You wake up early,

and then you get to be the first

person in the shower. Hm.

WALT JR.:

I have an idea.

How about

buy a new hot-water heater?

How's that idea?

For the million-billionth time.

[COUGHING]

Did you take your echinacea?

Yeah.

I think it's getting better.

What the hell is this?

Hey.

It's veggie bacon.

We're watching our cholesterol,

I guess.

Not me. I want real bacon.

N-not this fake crap.

Too bad. Eat it.

Phew.

This smells like Band-Aids.

Eat it.

[SIGHS]

So how does it feel to be old?

How does it feel

Heh. Good.

Eat your veggie bacon.

You're all set?

Okay, see you.

Chemistry.

It is the study of what?

Anyone?

Ben.

Chemicals.

Chemicals.

No.

Chemistry is...

Well, technically, chemistry

is the study of matter.

But I prefer to see it

as the study of change.

Now, just-- Just think about

this.

Electrons.

They

change their energy levels.

Molecules.

Molecules change their bonds.

Elements. They combine

and change into compounds.

Well, that's--

That's all of life, right?

I mean, it's just-- It's

the constant, it's the cycle.

It's solution, dissolution,

just over and over and over.

It is growth, then decay,

then transformation.

It is fascinating, really.

Hey, Walt. Everybody, listen up,

I'm gonna give a toast,

Oh, [MUTE]. Turn on channel three.

At which point, we apprehended

three individuals

I'm proud to say

the outstanding professionalism

of my fellow agents at the

Albuquerque District Office

resulted in a substantial

No, ma'am.

Our agents took the suspects

Damn. The TV does add 10 pounds.

Ten pounds?

Hey, sit and spin, both of you.

Hank.

What?

Sorry. You didn't see that.

So charming.

--clearly an ongoing operation.

One which was well-organized...

Hank, how much money is that?

It's about 700 grand.

It was a pretty good haul.

It's a good day

for the citizens of Albuquerque

Wow.

when we can put this big a dent

in the local drug trade.

Well, that's unusual, isn't it?

That kind of cash?

Mm. Well, it's not the most

we ever took.

It's easy money,

till we catch you.

Heh-heh.

Walt, just say the word and I'll

take you on a ride-along.

You can watch us knock down

a me** lab, huh?

Get a little excitement

in your life.

Yeah, someday.

Which one's this?

Um, that faux-Lalique vase

I picked up at the Super-Swap.

Oh.

How's it doing?

Well, I met my reserve

and there's still two minutes.

Mm.

What's up?

You tell me, birthday boy.

Oh, hey, so, what's up

for Saturday?

Mm. Car wash.

Bogdan says he needs me.

Till what time? Noon, 1-ish?

Probably 2, more like it.

And then what after that?

Um, actually,

ahem, I was thinking of driving

up to Los Alamos.

They've got this--

The visitor center

has an exhibit on

You're not gonna paint?

No, I'll paint.

It's just that this--

You know, this exhibition

I mean, the detail really is

just supposed to be amazing.

It's just that I really need you

to paint at some point.

The sooner that back bedroom

gets finished...

I know.

And I'd do it myself, except you

don't want me on the stepladder.

I will paint.

Okay.

What is going on down there?

No, it's--

Is he asleep?

No...

No, it's nothing. He's just...

You know. Well, you gotta be

Well, don't worry about

I didn't have the greatest

Hey, listen, can you do me

Yeah, let me look into that.

Okay.

So how goes the novel?

It's not a novel, actually,

You're not writing a novel?

No. Short stories.

But the pièce de résistance

a round bottom boiling flask,

Huh?

I cook in one of those.

A big one.

One of these?

No, this is an volumetric flask.

You wouldn't cook

in one of these.

Uh, yeah. I do.

Uh, no, you don't.

A volumetric flask is for

general mixing and titration.

You wouldn't apply heat

to a volumetric flask.

That's what a boiling flask

is for.

Did you not learn nothing

from my chemistry class?

No. You flunked me, remember?

No wonder.

Prick.

And let me tell you something

else. This ain't chemistry.

Okay, this is art.

No adulterants.

No baby formula.

No chili powder.

No, no. Chili P's my signature.

Not anymore.

Yeah, well,

we'll see about that.

What the hell is this?

Lab safety equipment.

We're also gonna have

an emergency eye wash station.

These chemicals

and their fumes are toxic.

In case you didn't you know

that.

Well, you can dress up like

a faggot if you want. Not me.

Listen, this stuff

doesn't stay more than a day.

What? I thought we were gonna

cook here.

No, we're not gonna cook here.

Okay, this is my house.

I don't [MUTE] where I eat.

Well, then where are we gonna

work?

You tell me.

This is your deal, man.

You wanna smoke it up,

smoke it up at your house.

No, I didn't think so. Oh, well.

Well,

what if we rented one of those

self-storage places?

You know, those little orange

garages? Worked out of there?

No, they're onto that. They've

got dogs that sniff around.

RV, that's what you want.

What, like a Winnebago?

Yeah.

I know a dude

who wants to sell his.

He just goes camping with it.

But a mobile me** lab?

That'd be the bomb.

You don't want to get them
