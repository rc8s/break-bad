We had a-- A faculty meeting

senior-class photos

You know, not necessarily

What up, beyotch?

Leave it at the tone.

[ANSWERING MACHINE BEEPS]

So the term "chiral"

derives from the Greek word

"hand."

Now, the concept here

being that

just as your left hand

and your right hand

are mirror images

of one another, right,

identical and yet opposite,

well, so, too,

organic compounds can exist

as mirror-image forms

of one another

all the way down

at the molecular level.

But although they may

look the same,

they don't always

behave the same.

For instance...

For instance...

Uh, I'm sorry.

Uh, for instance, uh...

Thalidomide.

The-- The right-handed isomer

of the drug thalidomide

is a perfectly fine,

good medicine

to give to a pregnant woman

to prevent morning sickness.

But make the mistake of giving

that same pregnant woman

the left-handed isomer

of the drug thalidomide

and her child will be born

with horrible birth defects.

Which is precisely what happened

in the 1950s.

So chiral, chirality,

mirrored images, right?

Active, inactive, good, bad.

Uh, so.

Yes, Ben.

Is this gonna be

on the murder?

What?

Is this gonna be

on the midterm?

Uh, chirality on the midterm?

[SCHOOL BELL RINGS]

No, no. Well, maybe.

Maybe. Yes, you know--

But prepare for it

to be on the midterm.

Can't hurt to know it, right?

So--

Knowledge is power.

Hey, yeah, Good idea.

Maybe I should do that

Okay, you know what?

I am sick--

Just-- All right.

All right!

Just--

The one downstairs,

tell me about him.

Oh, come on. Anything.

Something.

Start with his name,

at least.

Krazy-8.

Krazy-8. What the hell

does that even mean?

I don't know, man, okay?

It means, like-- Like,

Krazy-8, okay? I don't know.

So you work with him regularly.

No, not him so much.

His cousin, mainly.

Who's his cousin?

The-- The guy out in the RV.

All right, all right,

all right.

Krazy-8's one level higher.

One level higher.

Yeah, you know.

Not, like, street level. Higher.

You know how there's, like,

a Starbucks on every corner?

Krazy-8 is like the dude

that sells Starbucks' beans.

Okay, so he's a distributor.

Okay, so is he...?

I mean, is...?

In other words, what is his

reputation for violence?

Well, um, he did try

to kill us both yesterday,

so there's that.

Look, what I'm trying to say

is that he's a distributor,

right?

He's a-- He's a businessman.

He's a man of business.

It would therefore

seem to follow that he is

capable of acting out of

mutual self-interest, yes?

What?

Do you think he is capable

of listening to reason?

I mean, what--? What kind

of reason? You mean, like,

"Dear Krazy-8, hey, listen,

if I let you go,

"you promise not to come back

and waste my entire family?

No Colombian neckties?"

You mean that kind of reason?

No, man, I can't say as I have

where that's concerned.

What?

We didn't tie him up.

Why the hell

didn't we tie him up?

Oh, God.

Because he was out cold.

Yeah, but what--

What if he's faking it?

You know, like,

if it was me,

I'd be all faking

being knocked out, yo.

And then,

when the coast is clear,

I'd be up looking

for weapons and shit.

[LOUD GROANING]

[GRUNTING]

So now what do we do?

You keep asking me that

like you think I have

some answer.

Well, you gotta do something.

No, we.

We have got to do something,

and I am open to suggestions.

Man, uh, okay,

this whole thing was your deal.

Don't you dare put that on me.

You brought those guys

out there.

This is your responsibility.

Oh, like I came to you,

begging to cook meth.

"Oh, hey, nerdiest old dude

I know,

you wanna come cook crystal?"

Please.

I'd ask my diaper-wearing granny

but her wheelchair

wouldn't fit in the RV.

What about the, uh--

The-- The-- The phosphate gas?

The phosphine gas.

What about it?

Well, do-- I mean, do you think

it still might kill him?

You know, with, like,

a delayed reaction or something?

I-- I don't know.

You're supposed

to be a scientist.

Look, this isn't even

the issue

that demands

immediate attention.

We have got a body in that RV.

And it's getting warmer outside.

Understand?

And we have got to

do something about that soon.

And in a way that

no one will ever find it.

Now, that-- That last part

is very, very important.

Therefore, it seems to me

that our best course of action

would be chemical

disincorporation.

Dissolving in strong acid.

Oh, man, that's messed up.

I mean, ahem,

you're not serious.

You serious?

[SIGHS]

Well, who's gonna do that?

And don't look at me.

I guess we'll both do it

together.

No, Mr. White, okay, I'm not--

I'm not good with dead bodies.

Look, we are in this

fifty-fifty. Okay?

I guess the only other fair way

to go about this would be

that one of us deals with

the body situation

while the other one of us deals

with the Krazy-8 situation.

In a scenario like this,

I don't suppose it is bad form

to just flip a coin.

Heads or tails?

No, I'll-- I'll do the body

in the acid, okay?

Heads or tails?

Heads. Heads.
